FUSION 3.60
October 2016

Version 3.60 Changes
Updated all tools to use the latest release of LASzip.dll. Fixed some problems with the alignment of outputs from GridSurfaceStats, Catalog, ReturnDensity, and Intensity image. Lots of 
minor changes to several programs and the addition of options to some programs to make the toolset more consistent.

Fixed some problems where windows was requiring administrator priviledges to run a few programs realted to LTKProcessor. The problem was related to having the word "update" 
in the program name. If you have scripts generated with older version of LTKProcessor, you will still see warnings if you are not running with administrator priviledges.
New scripts generated by LTKProcessor should not have the problems.

Added new programs: 
AreaProcessor: New workflow generator for processing large acquistions
LTKStatusMonitorMDI: Tool to monitor the status of processing runs generated using AreaProcessor
TreeSeg: Implements a watershed segmentation algorithm using a canopy height model.

Version 3.50 Changes
Updated all programs to better support LAS version 1.4 format files and to provide a cleaner linkage to the LASzip.dll library. Lots of minor changes and bug fixes 
to many programs and a few major changes. New tools: TopoMetrics, to compute topographic metrics using a ground surface and SplitDTM to split large DTM files into smaller tiles for 
more efficient processing workflows. GridMetrics computes topographic metrics but the new tool adds a topographic position index and is much faster when you only need topographic metrics.

Version 3.42 Changes
Corrected some problems with GridMetrics related to the use of LAZ files (wasn't working) and ouptut of topographic 
metrics. Also fixed a problem with the scaling of LAS XYZ values when writing LAS and LAZ files. Values were
changing slightly (on the order of the precision specified in for the scaling.

Version 3.41 Changes
Minor changes to a few programs. Fix for FUSION when using LAZ files and addition of a warning that any sample dispay will be VERY slow when using LAZ
files.

Version 3.40 Changes
Major changes to the internals of most programs to use the LASzip.dll developed by Martin Isenburg. Additional changes that help when processing LAS
point files that contain erroneous points (files or points that co not comply with the LAS specification). A new option hase been added to Catalog (/validate:MaxReturnNumber)
that helps find problems with LAS files.

NOTE: The LDA2LAS program can be used to manipulate LAS point files in much the same way as the LAS2LAS program that is part of LASTools. The name was
left the same as in earlier versions of FUSION to prevent conflicts with LAS2LAS when both FUSION and LASTools are installed on the same computer.

Version 3.30 Changes
Changes to several command line programs to add features or fix bugs. Most changes affect a small portion of users. However, changes to
GridMetrics, CloudMetrics, and ClipData correct some problems with the behavior of specific options and format of outputs that may affect more
users.

V3.21
Minor change to the status monitoring programs used with LTKProcessor generated scripts. The status monitoring was not
working correctly (not at all). You can still load a file in LTKStatusMonitor using the "Browse" button and show the status of a 
running or completed job but the real-time monitoring was not working. This release corrects this problem.

V3.20
Modified the logic used to read LAS format files to read and write "extra bytes" stored with each point record. This allows FUSION to work with
some files collected using Riegl scanners (previous versions could not read files with "extra bytes" in the point records).

This distribution contains a fully functional versions of FUSION, LDV, and the LIDAR toolkit (LTK) programs 
developed by Robert J. McGaughey, USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station.  

If you are receiving FUSION on a CD:

The FUSION CD menu should appear automatically when you insert the CD. If it does not, browse to the 
root folder on the CD and double-click AUTORUN.EXE.  The autorun application presents you with a 
menu of options. If you want to install FUSION, LDV, and the example data onto your computer, be sure 
to use the “Install FUSION” button on the menu.  Simply copying the files from the CD to your hard drive 
will not result in a valid installation.

This distribution includes a manual that describes some of the basic operations in FUSION and the 
command line utilities. Online tutorials are available from the Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications 
Center (RSAC) (http://www.fs.fed.us/eng/rsac/). The tutorials cover basic operations and describe a 
variety of analysis and data processing that can be accomplished with FUSION and LTK.

The primary FUSION website is:
http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion

The latest version of FUSION is always available at:
http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html

You can check for newer versions of FUSION by accessing the Help…About menu option in FUSION and 
clicking the button labeled “Check for a newer version of FUSION”. This action will open a web page on 
the FUSION server that will indicate if the version of FUSION you have is the “latest version” and provide 
a link to the latest version of both the FUSION software and the manual.

I hope you find the software interesting and useful.  If you have questions or need assistance, call or 
email me.
